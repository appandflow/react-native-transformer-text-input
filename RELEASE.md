# Release process

Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag starts [Release](.github/workflows/release.yml).
The workflow validates the tag, repository metadata, and packed files, then runs
JavaScript, Android, and iOS checks on the same commit. After approval of the
`release` environment, it publishes the saved tarball through npm trusted
publishing with provenance. Stable releases use `latest`; prereleases use `next`.

## Release

1. Check npm's current versions and prepare the version bump in a separate PR.
2. Merge it after review and successful CI. Local npm publishing remains disabled
   in `release-it`.
3. Tag the merged commit, using the actual version in place of `X.Y.Z`:

   ```sh
   git switch main
   git pull --ff-only
   node scripts/check-release.mjs vX.Y.Z
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m 'Release X.Y.Z'
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

4. Approve the `release` environment after checks pass. Confirm npm publication:

   ```sh
   npm view react-native-transformer-text-input@X.Y.Z version dist.integrity dist.attestations --json
   npm view react-native-transformer-text-input dist-tags --json
   ```

5. Create the GitHub release:

   ```sh
   gh release create vX.Y.Z --verify-tag --generate-notes --title 'Release X.Y.Z'
   ```

Normal PR CI tests the release safeguards and inspects the package. Merging a PR
alone does not publish.

## Recovery

- Use `gh run rerun RUN_ID --failed` to retry a failed publish with the saved
  artifact, retained for seven days. Matching published versions are skipped;
  integrity mismatches fail. Retrying never moves a newer dist-tag backward.
- npm processing can take several minutes. Verification polls for up to ten
  minutes after acceptance. If it times out, check the exact registry version
  before retrying; do not blindly republish or bump the version.
- If the artifact expired, rerun all jobs. Reruns use the original workflow
  revision. Never move an already-published tag.
- For authentication failures, check the saved npm owner, repository, workflow,
  environment, and direct-publish permission. For provenance failures, check the
  repository URL casing in the tarball.
